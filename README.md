## EcoTrack
EcoTrack is expanding its environmental monitoring platform to include air quality management. The company requires a robust and scalable system to manage data collected from various air quality sensors.

## Assignment:

Develop a RESTful API to manage air quality sensor data. The API should provide functionality to create, read, update, and delete sensor data, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place. The API should support concurrent access by multiple clients and ensure high data availability.

## Additional Requirements:

API Documentation: Use Swagger or OpenAPI to create comprehensive documentation for the API.
HTTP Methods: Implement standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for all resources.
Error Handling: Ensure the API includes proper error handling and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

# Possible Questions and Answers:

Question: How will you ensure the security of your API?

Answer: We will use Access Tokens to authenticate users and implement role-based access control to restrict access based on permissions.
Question: What measures will you take to ensure the performance of your API?

Answer: We will implement data caching and optimize database queries. Additionally, we will consider horizontal scaling to handle high volumes of requests.
Question: How will you test your API?

Answer: We will write unit tests using tools like unittest for Python to ensure the core functionality works correctly. Integration tests will be conducted to verify interactions with other system components.
Question: What data formats will you use to pass information through the API?

Answer: We will use JSON format for data exchange between client and server due to its readability and widespread support.
Question: How will you ensure data consistency across parallel queries?

Answer: We will use database transactions to maintain data integrity during create, update, and delete operations.

## Database Details:

# Tables:

Sensors: Contains information about each sensor (ID, type, model, installation date, status).
Data: Stores air quality measurements (PM2.5, PM10, CO2 levels, timestamps).
Alerts: Contains information about high pollution events (sensor ID, event description, timestamp).
Relations:

The Data and Alerts tables are linked to the Sensors table via foreign keys to maintain data integrity and optimize queries.
